Dear Jason,<br>

I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective August 14, 2020.<br>
<br>
I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. I’m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.
<br><br>
I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positive, inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.
<br><br>
I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me. 
<br><br>
Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.
<br><br>
Thanks, and best wishes,
<br><br>
Nicole Thomas (signature hard copy letter)
